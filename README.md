# Computer Science 1

My CSCI Class work

# Personal notes

I will be using Jetbrains CLion, easier to work with than Visual Studio from my experiences

I am a self-taught developer, I do game and software development. As a hobby, I create websites, both front end and 
backend or fullstack apps on Fiverr. In my free time, I create games or software that benefits me or just learn
something new.
